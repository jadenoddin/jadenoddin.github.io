<p> Hello! This page is where I'm gonna talk a little bit about me.
 My name is Jade Noddin and I'm a junior at the University of Maine, major in Marketing with a concentration in Entreprenuership.
 I went to California for the first time in January 2019 to go visit my cousins who moved there recently.
